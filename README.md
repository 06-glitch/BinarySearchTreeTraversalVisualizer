# tree-traverse

This is a simple web app visualizing Tree Data structure traversal using React.

The user can create a tree by inserting nodes and then choose between different traversals to see how they run in effect.
As of now, Inorder, Preoder and Postorder traversals are visualized. Features like search (DFS,BFS) will be implemented soon.
